# UOCS322 - Project 0

Trivial project to exercise version control, turn-in, and other mechanisms
for CIS 322.



- Replace these instructions with a proper README including the
   author, contact address, and a brief description of what the
   software does.

- Test, commit, push, test again, and turn in.
   - Use `make install` to set up.
   - Use `make run` to run.
   - Use `git status` to monitor changes
   - Use `git add $FILE` to stage files (new and existing). 
   		- **DO NOT ADD/PUSH `credentials.ini`!**
   - Use `git commit -m $MESSAGE` to commit staged changes (those `add`ed) with a commit message.
   - Use `git push` to push local commits.
   - To test, clone elsewhere (the server), and test (do `make install` and `make run`), it should work as expected.
   - Turn the project in by submitting your **filled in** `credentials.ini` file to Canvas.
